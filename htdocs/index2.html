            <p class="hehe">Genshin Impact is a gacha game, that released in September of 2020. It is one of the best-selling games right now. It features open-world, puzzle, story mechanics that will and have intrigued every player that has come in to this game. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes anime and stories. The picture in the background is the place where you start in, Mondstadt. The story progresses as the main character is seperated from his/her sibling, and goes through a whole world full of twists and turns, just to find this lost sibling of theirs. Personally, I love this game and have been playing ever since its launch. Given the chance to advocate this game to others, I took the chance and made it my project topic. </p>
