                Welcome to Liyue! Liyue is the Nation of Contracts as its God, the God of Geo, known as Rex Lapis. The story of Liyue starts with the God of Geo faking his death, with a contract with a affiliation renown around Teyvat known as The Fatui. The contract stated that once the people of Liyue could stand on their own, he would give his gnosis to the Fatui. The gnosis is the main power source of an archon so losing it would be very bad. Liyue is based on a Chinese culture and follows all the design and rites of it. In my opinion, Liyue is a very scenic region, the music is hovering on the left.
