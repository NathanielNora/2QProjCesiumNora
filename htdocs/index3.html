            <h1 class="h11">WELCOME TO MONDSTADT!</h1>

            <div class="mond">Mondstadt is dubbed as the "City of Freedom" as the god residing over it had let the people do what they want.<br>
                This is the first region that the players enter as they travel through Teyvat. They meet beginner characters such as Kaeya, Amber and Lisa.<br>
                As you progress through the story, you fight a dragon named Dvalin and meet the Anemo God himself.

            <div class="fig"> fig 1.1 Dvalin and the Anemo God Barbatos.</div>

            <div class="mond">Mondstadt has an extra place that was added in Version 1.2 in December 2020, which is Dragonspine. This was the first time <br>
                that they had added a new region to explore in the game. It added a lot of ties to some lore of the game due to some of the residents getting lost in the mountain. The sheer cold feature in Dragonspine which if had pent up, will start to kill you.<br>
                The story behind Dragonspine is that it was once a mountain that had a civilization living on it. Durin, who was considered to be an evil dragon had fought Dvalin and lost. His remains fell to  dragonspine and infused the mountain  with a bad omen. This led to the civilization falling.
