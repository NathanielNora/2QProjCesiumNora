                Inazuma is an archipelago nation that is under the Raiden Shogun's rule, more known as the Electro Archon, She is the God of Electro. Inazuma is located southeast from Liyue Harbor. Inazuma is culturally referenced to Japan. Before the traveller arrives, the nation is under a Sakoku Decree and the Vision Hunt Decree. Just like Japan, they locked down the country because of the Sakoku Decree. The Vision Hunt Decree declared that all Visions, which are catalysts of elemental power, are to be surrendered and put up in the statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God. Inazuma has five islands to its archipelago, which are shown below. Narukami Island is the main island of Inazuma within it is Inazuma City and other places like the Grand Narukami Shrine. Kannazuka is another island of Inazuma containing the Mikage Furnace, and the disputed territory between the Inazuma Shogunate and the Watatsumi Rebellion. Yashiori Island is covered with rain due to it being full of evil energy, because an ancient god's remains are on the island. The island of Watatsumi is where the Sangonomiya Clan resides and so does the Reistance. Seirai Island was another island full of civilization but, the island had experienced a great calamity and the center of the island had been endlessy stormed by lightning and thunder.
